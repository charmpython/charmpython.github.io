## Welcome to Charmpython's Blog! 

Thanks for coming! Here you'll find a few little stories about some of the big learning experiences I've had. These experiences were so powerful I had to cope somehow, so I drew them out as comics.  

### About Me 

My two main goals in the workplace are: 

1. To remain curious
2. To be a hard worker 

Both of these have led me to some interesting, if not linear, places. 

### Why did I post this journey? 

This blog is a celebration of all of the help I've gotten along the way. The best helpers help without expectation of reward. But great mentors - who are patient, present, and excellent guides - deserve both rewards and awards because of the multiplier effect of their actions.

Also, success can come in many forms. It doesn't always have to rock your world. Sometimes it can be quiet, like the triumph that comes with understanding something challenging. This journey has been marked with many quiet triumphs. 

### Enjoy!
